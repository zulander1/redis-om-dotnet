## üí° Why Redis OM?

Redis OM provides high-level abstractions for using Redis in .NET, making it easy to model and query your Redis domain objects.

This **preview** release contains the following features:

* Declarative object mapping for Redis objects
* Declarative secondary-index generation
* Fluent APIs for querying Redis
* Fluent APIs for performing Redis aggregations

## üíª Installation

Using the dotnet cli, run:

```text
dotnet add package Redis.OM
```

## üèÅ Getting started

### Starting Redis

Before writing any code you'll need a Redis instance with the appropriate Redis modules! The quickest way to get this is with Docker:

```sh
docker run -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack
```

This launches the [redis-stack](https://redis.io/docs/stack/) an extension of Redis that adds all manner of modern data structures to Redis. You'll also notice that if you open up http://localhost:8001 you'll have access to the redis-insight GUI, a GUI you can use to visualize and work with your data in Redis.

### üìá Modeling your domain (and indexing it!)

With Redis OM, you can model your data and declare indexes with minimal code. For example, here's how we might model a customer object:

```csharp
[Document(StorageType = StorageType.Json)]
public class Customer
{
   [Indexed] public string FirstName { get; set; }
   [Indexed] public string LastName { get; set; }
   public string Email { get; set; }
   [Indexed(Sortable = true)] public int Age { get; set; }
   [Indexed] public string[] NickNames {get; set;}
}
```

Notice that we've applied the `Document` attribute to this class. We've also specified that certain fields should be `Indexed`.

Now we need to create the Redis index. So we'll connect to Redis and then call `CreateIndex` on an `IRedisConnection`:


```csharp
var provider = new RedisConnectionProvider("redis://localhost:6379");
provider.Connection.CreateIndex(typeof(Customer));
```

### Indexing Embedded Documents

There are two methods for indexing embedded documents with Redis.OM, an embedded document is a complex object, e.g. if our `Customer` model had an `Address` property with the following model:

```csharp
[Document(IndexName = "address-idx", StorageType = StorageType.Json)]
public partial class Address
{
    public string StreetName { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
    [Indexed] public string City { get; set; }
    [Indexed] public string State { get; set; }
    [Indexed(CascadeDepth = 1)] public Address ForwardingAddress { get; set; }
    [Indexed] public GeoLoc Location { get; set; }
    [Indexed] public int HouseNumber { get; set; }
}
```

#### Index By JSON Path

You can index fields by JSON path, in the top level model, in this case `Customer` you can decorate the `Address` property with an `Indexed` and/or `Searchable` attribute, specifying the JSON path to the desired field:

```csharp
[Document(StorageType = StorageType.Json)]
public class Customer
{
   [Indexed] public string FirstName { get; set; }
   [Indexed] public string LastName { get; set; }
   public string Email { get; set; }
   [Indexed(Sortable = true)] public int Age { get; set; }
   [Indexed] public string[] NickNames {get; set;}
   [Indexed(JsonPath = "$.ZipCode")]
   [Searchable(JsonPath = "$.StreetAddress")]
   public Address Address {get; set;}
}
```

##### Indexing Arrays of Objects

This methodology can also be used for indexing string and string-like value-types within objects within Arrays and Lists, so for example if we had an array of Addresses, and we wanted to index the cities within those addresses we could do so with the following

```cs
[Indexed(JsonPath = "$.City")]
public Address[] Addresses { get; set; }
```

Those Cities can then be queried with an `Any` predicate within the main `Where` clause.

```cs
collection.Where(c=>c.Addresses.Any(a=>a.City == "Satellite Beach"))
```

#### Cascading Index

Alternatively, you can also embedded models by cascading indexes. In this instance you'd simply decorate the property with `Indexed` and set the `CascadeDepth` to whatever to however may levels you want the model to cascade for. The default is 0, so if `CascadeDepth` is not set, indexing an object will be a no-op:

```csharp
[Document(StorageType = StorageType.Json)]
public class Customer
{
   [Indexed] public string FirstName { get; set; }
   [Indexed] public string LastName { get; set; }
   public string Email { get; set; }
   [Indexed(Sortable = true)] public int Age { get; set; }
   [Indexed] public string[] NickNames {get; set;}
   [Indexed(CascadeDepth = 2)]
   public Address Address {get; set;}
}
```

In the above case, all indexed/searchable fields in Address will be indexed down 2 levels, so the `ForwardingAddress` field in `Address` will also be indexed.

Once the index is created, we can:

* Insert Customer objects into Redis
* Get a Customer object by ID from Redis
* Query Customers from Redis
* Run aggregations on Customers in Redis

Let's see how!

### Indexing DateTimes

As of version 0.4.0, all DateTime objects are indexed as numerics, and they are inserted as numerics into JSON documents. Because of this, you can query them as if they were numerics!

### üîë Keys and Ids

#### ULIDs and strings

Ids are unique per object, and are used as part of key generation for the primary index in Redis. The natively supported Id type in Redis OM is the [ULID][ulid-url]. You can bind ids to your model, by explicitly decorating your Id field with the `RedisIdField` attribute:

```csharp
[Document(StorageType = StorageType.Json)]
public class Customer
{
    [RedisIdField] public Ulid Id { get; set; }
    [Indexed] public string FirstName { get; set; }
    [Indexed] public string LastName { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    [Indexed(Sortable = true)] public int Age { get; set; }
    [Indexed] public string[] NickNames { get; set; }
}
```

When you call `Set` on the `RedisConnection` or call `Insert` in the `RedisCollection`, to insert your object into Redis, Redis OM will automatically set the id  for you and you will be able to access it in the object. If the `Id` type is a string, and there is no explicitly overriding IdGenerationStrategy on the object, the ULID for the object will bind to the string.

#### Other types of ids

Redis OM also supports other types of ids, ids must either be strings or value types (e.g. ints, longs, GUIDs etc. . .), if you want a non-ULID id type, you must either set the id on each object prior to insertion, or you must register an `IIdGenerationStrategy` with the `DocumentAttribute` class.

##### Register IIdGenerationStrategy

To Register an `IIdGenerationStrategy` with the `DocumentAttribute` class, simply call `DocumentAttribute.RegisterIdGenerationStrategy` passing in the strategy name, and the implementation of `IIdGenerationStrategy` you want to use. Let's say for example you had the `StaticIncrementStrategy`, which maintains a static counter in memory, and increments ids based off that counter:

```csharp
public class StaticIncrementStrategy : IIdGenerationStrategy
{
    public static int Current = 0;
    public string GenerateId()
    {
        return (Current++).ToString();
    }
}
```

You would then register that strategy with Redis.OM like so:

```csharp
DocumentAttribute.RegisterIdGenerationStrategy(nameof(StaticIncrementStrategy), new StaticIncrementStrategy());
```

Then, when you want to use that strategy for generating the Ids of a document, you can simply set the IdGenerationStrategy of your document attribute to the name of the strategy.

```csharp
[Document(IdGenerationStrategyName = nameof(StaticIncrementStrategy))]
public class ObjectWithCustomIdGenerationStrategy
{
    [RedisIdField] public string Id { get; set; }
}
```

#### Key Names

The key names are, by default, the fully qualified class name of the object, followed by a colon, followed by the `Id`. For example, there is a Person class in the Unit Test project, an example id of that person class would be `Redis.OM.Unit.Tests.RediSearchTests.Person:01FTHAF0D1EKSN0XG67HYG36GZ`, because `Redis.OM.Unit.Tests.RediSearchTests.Person` is the fully qualified class name, and `01FTHAF0D1EKSN0XG67HYG36GZ` is the ULID (the default id type). If you want to change the prefix (the fully qualified class name), you can change that in the `DocumentAttribute` by setting the `Prefixes` property, which is an array of strings e.g.

```csharp
[Document(Prefixes = new []{"Person"})]
public class Person
```

> Note: At this time, Redis.OM will only use the first prefix in the prefix list as the prefix when creating a key name. However, when an index is created, it will be created on all prefixes enumerated in the Prefixes property

### üîé Querying

We can query our domain using expressions in LINQ, like so:

```csharp
var customers = provider.RedisCollection<Customer>();

// Insert customer
customers.Insert(new Customer()
{
    FirstName = "James",
    LastName = "Bond",
    Age = 68,
    Email = "bondjamesbond@email.com"
});

// Find all customers whose last name is "Bond"
customers.Where(x => x.LastName == "Bond");

// Find all customers whose last name is Bond OR whose age is greater than 65
customers.Where(x => x.LastName == "Bond" || x.Age > 65);

// Find all customers whose last name is Bond AND whose first name is James
customers.Where(x => x.LastName == "Bond" && x.FirstName == "James");

// Find all customers with the nickname of Jim
customers.Where(x=>x.NickNames.Contains("Jim"));
```

### üñ© Aggregations

We can also run aggregations on the customer object, again using expressions in LINQ:

```csharp
// Get our average customer age
customerAggregations.Average(x => x.RecordShell.Age);

// Format customer full names
customerAggregations.Apply(x => string.Format("{0} {1}", x.RecordShell.FirstName, x.RecordShell.LastName),
      "FullName");

// Get each customer's distance from the Mall of America
customerAggregations.Apply(x => ApplyFunctions.GeoDistance(x.RecordShell.Home, -93.241786, 44.853816),
      "DistanceToMall");
```

## üìö Documentation

This README just scratches the surface. You can find a full tutorial on the [Redis Developer Site](https://developer.redis.com/develop/dotnet/redis-om-dotnet/getting-started/). All the summary docs for this library can be found on the repo's [github page](https://redis.github.io/redis-om-dotnet/).

## ‚õèÔ∏è Troubleshooting

## ‚ú® Redis Stack

Redis OM can be used with regular Redis for Object mapping and getting objects by their IDs. For more advanced features like indexing, querying, and aggregation, Redis OM is dependent on the [**Redis Stack**](https://redis.io/docs/stack/) platform, a collection of modules that extend Redis.

### Why this is important

Without Redis Stack, you can still use Redis OM to create declarative models backed by Redis.

We'll store your model data in Redis as Hashes, and you can retrieve models using their primary keys.

So, what won't work without Redis Stack?

1. You won't be able to nest models inside each other.
2. You won't be able to use our expressive queries to find object -- you'll only be able to query by primary key.

### So how do you get Redis Stack?

You can use Redis Stack with your self-hosted Redis deployment. Just follow the instructions for [Installing Redis Stack](https://redis.io/docs/stack/get-started/install/).

Don't want to run Redis yourself? Redis Stack is also available on Redis Cloud. [Get started here](https://redis.com/try-free/).
